1. Select all columns from a table
SELECT * FROM my_table_name;

2. Select specific columns with conditions
SELECT column1, column2 FROM my_table_name WHERE condition;

3. Filter data using WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM my_table_name WHERE column_name = 'value';

4. Join two tables
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;

5. Aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG)
SELECT COUNT(column_name) AS total_count, AVG(another_column) AS average_value
FROM my_table_name
WHERE condition;

6. Group by and HAVING clause
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM my_table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

7. Order by with sorting
SELECT * FROM my_table_name
ORDER BY column_name DESC; -- or ASC for ascending order

8. Insert data into a table
INSERT INTO my_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES ('value1', 'value2');

9. Update data in a table
UPDATE my_table_name
SET column_name = 'new_value'
WHERE condition;

10. Delete rows from a table
DELETE FROM my_table_name
WHERE condition;

11. Exercize from SQL Learning tool
SELECT
  d.doctor_id as doctor_id,
  CONCAT(d.first_name,' ', d.last_name) as doctor_name,
  d.specialty,
  YEAR(a.admission_date) as selected_year,
  COUNT(*) as total_admissions
FROM doctors as d
  LEFT JOIN admissions as a ON d.doctor_id = a.attending_doctor_id
GROUP BY
  doctor_name,
  selected_year
ORDER BY doctor_id, selected_year
